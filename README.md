# From zero to hero with the Reactive extensions for JavaScript

Reactive and functional programming, you have probably heard the term mentioned before. Itâ€™s supposed to be really cool and a good practice. But what is reactive programming exactly and how to get started with it in JavaScript? And why does Angular start using the reactive extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) instead of standard promises?

In this presentation, Maurice is going to show you how to get started with RxJS, the JavaScript implementation of the ReactiveX library. You will learn why using RxJS is a great way of dealing with streams of events in an asynchronous and functional way.
